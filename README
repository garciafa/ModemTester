ModemTester allows one to script tests on boost::asio managed devices.

It can be used on serial ports or even on tcp sockets, unix sockets, ...

It uses two modes of test: availability and throughput.

In availability mode the master sends one byte of data regularly which is sent back by the remote.
Loss ratio and average RTT are then computed.

In throughput mode the master sends data as fast as possible. When it requires results, the remote
then sends back the number of bytes receives in which amount of time.
