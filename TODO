GENERAL:
    - Use a logging system so as to let the client program decide what level of info is printed

    - Add documentation

Throughput testing:
    - Make a simple protocol to test all data was received by master and send the throughput profile rather than the total
    - Getting results needs a clean timeout (related to previous entry ?)

EventsScript:
    - Add reading the script from a file
    - Should make it possible to check if in the right state or reschedule everything so that we are (duration change to absolute to relative since previous event)

main.cpp:
    - Add support for setting baud rate
    - Factorize Master / Remote behaviours
    - In master behaviour, read the script from a file
